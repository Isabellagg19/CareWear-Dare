           <p class="start">First, let's breake it down a little bit</p>
           <p class="space">You’ve probably heard of Shein. Maybe you’ve even bought from it. The prices are tempting and I don’t blame you.</p>
           <p class="space">But here’s the catch: when clothes are extremely cheap, someone else is paying the real price.</p>
           <p class="space">Fast fashion is a system built on producing massive amounts of clothing, as fast and as cheaply as possible. Most of it is made from synthetic fibers like polyester basically plastic that can take hundreds of years to break down. Toxic chemicals pollute rivers. Microplastics enter our oceans.</p>
           <p class="space">And it’s not just the environment. Many of these clothes are made in vulnerable countries under harsh working conditions.</p>
           <p class="space">So no, it’s not just about fashion.
It’s about impact.</p>
