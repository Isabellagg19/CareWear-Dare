        <h3>Week I</h3>
        <div class="subtitle">
            <p class="start">Let’s start with some context.</p>
            <p class="space">If you’re wondering what fast fashion is, and why it’s such a big deal, let’s talk about it.</p>
            <p class="space">Does the name Shein ring a bell?, If it does, you’ve probably bought something from there. And honestly? I don’t blame you. The prices are unbelievably cheap. It feels accessible. It feels convenient. It feels harmless.</p>
            <p class="space">But that’s exactly the illusion.</p>
            <p class="space">Fast fashion is a production model designed to make clothes in massive quantities, at lightning speed, and at the lowest possible cost, just to keep up with trends that change every week. New drops. New collections. New “must-haves.” It sounds efficient. It sounds innovative.</p>
            <p class="space">But here’s the truth: When something is cheap for you, it’s expensive for something else. And in this case, the one paying the real price is our planet.</p>
            <p class="space">Most fast fashion garments are made with synthetic fibers like polyester, essentially plastic. Every time we wash them, they release microplastics into our oceans. When we throw them away, they can take hundreds, even thousands, of years to decompose.</p>
            <p class="space">To make matters worse, toxic chemicals are used to dye and treat these clothes. Many of those chemicals end up in rivers and water systems, poisoning ecosystems and sometimes even contaminating the water communities rely on.</p>
            <p class="space">And the damage doesn’t stop there. Behind the low prices are real people. Many of these garments are produced in vulnerable countries, where workers, often women, endure exhausting hours, unsafe conditions, and extremely low wages.</p>
