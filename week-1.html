        <h3>Week I</h3>
        <div class="subtitle">
            <p>Let’s start with some context.</p>
            <p>If you’re wondering what fast fashion is, and why it’s such a big deal, let’s talk about it.</p>
            <p class="space">Does the name Shein ring a bell?</p>
            <p>If it does, you’ve probably bought something from there. And honestly? I don’t blame you.</p>
            <p>The prices are unbelievably cheap. It feels accessible. It feels convenient. It feels harmless.</p>
            <p class="space">But that’s exactly the illusion.</p>
            <p class="space">Fast fashion is a production model designed to make clothes in massive quantities, at</p>
            <p>lightning speed, and at the lowest possible cost, just to keep up with trends that change</p>
            <p>every week. New drops. New collections. New “must-haves.”</p>
            <p class="space">It sounds efficient. It sounds innovative.</p>
            <p class="space">But here’s the truth:</p>
            <p>When something is cheap for you, it’s expensive for something else.</p>
            <p class="space">And in this case, the one paying the real price is our planet.</p>
            <p class="space">Most fast fashion garments are made with synthetic fibers like polyester, essentially</p>
            <p>plastic. Every time we wash them, they release microplastics into our oceans. When we</p>
            <p>throw them away, they can take hundreds, even thousands, of years to decompose.</p>
            <p class="space">To make matters worse, toxic chemicals are used to dye and treat these clothes. Many of</p>
            <p>those chemicals end up in rivers and water systems, poisoning ecosystems and sometimes</p>
            <p>even contaminating the water communities rely on.</p>
            <p class="space">And the damage doesn’t stop there.</p>
            <p class="space">Behind the low prices are real people. Many of these garments are produced in vulnerable</p>
            <p>countries, where workers, often women, endure exhausting hours, unsafe conditions,</p>
            <p>and extremely low wages.</p>
